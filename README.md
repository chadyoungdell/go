# README for go-hello.git.snap
This is a basic "Hello World!" Golang program and converted into a snap. This
snap is meant to be used as a reference on how-to create snaps for Ubuntu Core
16 and as such would not be used in a production environment. As with anything
you find on the internet please proceed with caution as you never know when
Gremlins, Goblins, or Trolls will appear.  

## How to install
Install the snap that is created using the --devmode option.  

## How to run
From the command prompt run "go-hello.run" (minus quotes)
